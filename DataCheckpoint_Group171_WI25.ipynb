    "The San Diego housing market has undergone significant transformations in recent years, with investors playing an increasingly prominent role. Traditional economic indicators such as employment rates, interest rates, and median household income have historically been reliable predictors of housing market movements. However, the growing presence of investors has introduced new dynamics that may affect market behavior in ways not fully captured by conventional metrics.\n",
    "\n",
    "Recent analysis by Redfin (2024) highlights the substantial impact of investor activity in San Diego's housing market. Their research indicates that in the second quarter of 2024, investors purchased 23.7% of homes sold in San Diego, positioning the city as the second-highest in the U.S. for investor home purchases, following Miami at 28.5%. This level of investor activity represents a significant portion of market transactions and potentially influences local market dynamics. The study provides crucial baseline data about investor purchase volumes but leaves open questions about the relationship between investor activity and price movements at the zip code level.[1]\n",
    "\n",
    "The impact of investors on local housing markets extends beyond simple purchase statistics. As reported by CBS 8 San Diego (2024), local officials and real estate experts have expressed both concern and optimism about investor activity in the market. While increased investor presence may signal long-term market strength, it also raises concerns about competition with first-time homebuyers and potential market distortions. San Diego County Supervisor Terra Lawson-Remer has highlighted the important distinction between local \"mom-and-pop\" landlords and large institutional investors, noting that the latter may have different impacts on community stability and housing affordability.[2]\n",
    "\n",
    "This research aims to build upon these findings by examining the specific relationship between investor activity and housing price movements at the zip code level, providing a more granular understanding of how different types of investor activity correlate with local market dynamics. By analyzing rates of change between investor purchase percentages and home purchase prices by zip code, we can better understand whether areas with higher investment activity experience accelerated price appreciation compared to areas with less investor presence.\n",

    "\n",
    "Data privacy concerns exist regarding property transaction records and demographic information. While most of this data is publicly available, we must ensure our analysis doesn't inadvertently reveal personally identifiable information about individual property owners or tenants. We will aggregate data at the zip code level to maintain privacy. And for those datasets without zip code, we would assign them based on the region or new index to avoid use of any personal information. Besides that, most public datasets have their own restriction policy. For example, Zillow’s market data is available for public viewing but cannot be scraped, stored, or republished without permission. Therefore, ensuring data sets that been used are authorized is another priority.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Bias in Data Collection & Representation\n",
    "\n",
    "There are potential biases in our dataset that need to be acknowledged and addressed. Institutional investor activity may be underreported in certain areas, and some demographic groups might be disproportionately affected by investor activity. We will Cross-reference LLC-owned property counts with proprietary databases like ATTOM, CoreLogic to identify underreported areas. and Compare distributions of race, income, and age in the dataset against 2020 U.S. Census data for San Diego County at the zip code level. For example, mark as underrepresented if Hispanic residents constitute 35% of the county population but only 20% of sampled property owners, and further consider culture difference(like tend to live with family member) to test if bias still persist.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Detection and Mitigation of Bias\n",
    "\n",
    "Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) will be conducted to examine demographic distributions and missing data patterns. If biases are detected, adjustments such as re-weighting or stratified sampling will be applied.For example, if gaps exceed 5% absolute difference from Census demographics, methods would be apply to restore the balance.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Post-Analysis Considerations\n",
    "\n",
    "The findings of this research could have implications for housing policy and community development. We must be transparent about our methodology and careful not to draw causative conclusions where only correlative relationships exist. We will also consider the potential impact of our findings on various stakeholders, including local residents, policymakers, and market participants.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Impact on the Market & Community\n",
    "\n",
    "As mentioned above, since we have to keep our research transparent, we are aware that revealing areas with high investor activity can unintentionally provide insights for all kinds of market participants, which can further exacerbate affordability problems. If investors significantly raise affordability, this could lead to more displacement in lower-income neighborhoods. In order to minimize such a problem, we would hope to share findings with all stakeholders including members of the community with a vested interest in housing equity."
