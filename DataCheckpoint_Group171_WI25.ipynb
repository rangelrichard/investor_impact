    "## Research Question\n",
    "*\"Using a weighted average model, (utilizing specifically, median income trends, and median sales trends), how does investor activity in San Diego’s housing market correlate with housing price movements at the zip code level, and do areas with higher investor activity (measured by an increase in purchases by known institutional investors) experience faster price appreciation than those with lower investor activity?\"*\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Background and Prior Work \n",
    "The San Diego housing market has undergone significant transformations in recent years, with investors playing an increasingly prominent role. Traditional economic indicators such as employment rates, interest rates, and median household income have historically been reliable predictors of housing market movements. However, the growing presence of investors has introduced new dynamics that may affect market behavior in ways not fully captured by conventional metrics.\n",
    "\n",
    "Recent analysis by Redfin (2024) highlights the substantial impact of investor activity in San Diego's housing market. Their research indicates that in the second quarter of 2024, investors purchased 23.7% of homes sold in San Diego, positioning the city as the second-highest in the U.S. for investor home purchases, following Miami at 28.5%. This level of investor activity represents a significant portion of market transactions and potentially influences local market dynamics. The study provides crucial baseline data about investor purchase volumes but leaves open questions about the relationship between investor activity and price movements at the zip code level.[1]\n",
    "\n",
    "The impact of investors on local housing markets extends beyond simple purchase statistics. As reported by CBS 8 San Diego (2024), local officials and real estate experts have expressed both concern and optimism about investor activity in the market. While increased investor presence may signal long-term market strength, it also raises concerns about competition with first-time homebuyers and potential market distortions. San Diego County Supervisor Terra Lawson-Remer has highlighted the important distinction between local \"mom-and-pop\" landlords and large institutional investors, noting that the latter may have different impacts on community stability and housing affordability.[2]\n",
    "\n",
    "This research aims to build upon these findings by examining the specific relationship between investor activity and housing price movements at the zip code level, providing a more granular understanding of how different types of investor activity correlate with local market dynamics. By analyzing rates of change between investor purchase percentages and home purchase prices by zip code, we can better understand whether areas with higher investment activity experience accelerated price appreciation compared to areas with less investor presence.\n",

    "## Hypothesis\n",
    "We predict that zip codes with higher investor activity (measured by the percentage of home purchases made by institutional investors) will experience faster home price appreciation than zip codes with lower investor activity. Additionally, we expect that this correlation will be stronger in lower-income areas, where investors may have a larger influence on housing supply and affordability.\n",

    "## Data overview\n",
    "\n",
    "For each dataset include the following information\n",
    "- Dataset #1\n",
    "  - Dataset Name: Redfin Investor Activity in San Diego\n",
    "  - Link to the dataset: https://www.redfin.com/news/data-center/investor-data/   (Can download the data by selecting 'Download Data' column, select investor market share by zip code and choose San Diego CA in Redfin Metro)\n",
    "  - Number of observations: 101\n",
    "  - Number of variables: 5 \n",
    "  This dataset contains zip code-level investor activity in the San Diego housing market. In this data table, \"Zip Code\" identifying the location, \"Share of Sales\" representing the proportion of total home sales attributed to investors, \"Investor Purchases\" showing the number of homes bought by investors, and \"All Home Sales\" showing the total number of homes sold in each zip code. These variables serve as representing for investor influence in the housing market. The dataset will require data type conversions(such as drop% and convert to float), and possibly calculate standardizing numerical values for analysis.\n",
    "- Dataset #2 \n",
    "  - Dataset Name: Zillow Home Value Index (Zillow ZHVI)\n",
    "  - Link to the dataset: https://www.zillow.com/research/data/ (Can downoad the data from the 'Home Values' Section, default data type, geography by zip code)\n",
    "  - Number of observations: 26323 \n",
    "  - Number of variables: 357\n",
    "  This dataset tracks monthly median home values at the zip code level from 1996 to 2024, providing a historical perspective on housing price trends. In this data table \"RegionName\" (zip code), \"CountyName\" (San Diego County), and a series of columns with home values over time (floats). The dataset serves as a representing for market appreciation and affordability trends. Preprocessing steps include filtering for San Diego zip codes, reshaping data from wide to long format if there are similar zip code, converting date columns, and handling missing or erroneous values.\n",
    "- Combining the Datasets\n",
    "  - To analyze the relationship between investor activity and price trends, the datasets will be merged on zip codes. The Redfin dataset provides investor activity, while the Zillow dataset tracks price trends over time. The combined dataset will allow us to examine whether zip codes with higher investor activity experience faster price appreciation, using statistical correlation to check if there is a strong connection between investor activity and price changes. And regression models to measure how much investor activity actually affects home prices, while also considering other factors like overall market trends. \n",
    "  - Drawback: The redfin data by zipcode doesn't record the date(year, month, etc), but the website clarified the data were recorded from 2000, and according to the Investor Market Share by Metro, the latest date recorded is 2024 Q3. Our team will assume it represent investor activity from 2000 to 2024. We will match it with the Zillow's date after we filter it. Even though investor activity may have changed over time, this approach will still help us see whether areas with more investor purchases tend to have faster home price growth compared to other areas.\n"

    "## Ethics & Privacy\n",
    "- **Data Privacy & Restriction** \n",
    "\n",
    "    Data privacy concerns exist regarding property transaction records and demographic information. While most of this data is publicly available, we must ensure our analysis doesn't inadvertently reveal personally identifiable information about individual property owners or tenants. We will aggregate data at the zip code level to maintain privacy. And for those datasets without zip code, we would assign them based on the region or new index to avoid use of any personal information. Besides that, most public datasets have their own restriction policy. For example, Zillow’s market data is available for public viewing but cannot be scraped, stored, or republished without permission. Therefore, ensuring data sets that been used are authorized is another priority.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Bias in Data Collection & Representation**  \n",
    "\n",
    "    Our dataset may contain biases that need to be identified and addressed. Certain areas or groups may be underrepresented due to limitations in data collection, institutional investor activity, or other factors. To detect underreporting, we will analyze patterns within the dataset and use proxy variables where appropriate, ensuring they are validated against external benchmarks. Additionally, we will assess whether ZIP code-level aggregation introduces any biases and adjust our methodology if needed. \n",
    "\n",
    "- **Detection and Mitigation of Bias** \n",
    "\n",
    "   As part of the Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) we will assess demographic distributions and identify patterns of missing data. If biases are detected, we will apply corrective measures such as re-weighting or stratified sampling to improve representation. For example, a potential scenario could be if the proportion of a demographic group in our dataset deviates by more than 5 percentage points from Census data, adjustments will be made to restore balance and ensure the dataset more accurately reflects real-world populations.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Post-Analysis Considerations** \n",
    "    \n",
    "    The findings of this research could have implications for housing policy and community development. We must be transparent about our methodology and careful not to draw causative conclusions where only correlative relationships exist. We will also consider the potential impact of our findings on various stakeholders, including local residents, policymakers, and market participants.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Impact on the Market & Community** \n",
    "\n",
    "    As mentioned above, since we have to keep our research transparent, we are aware that revealing areas with high investor activity can unintentionally provide insights for all kinds of market participants, which can further exacerbate affordability problems. If investors significantly raise affordability, this could lead to more displacement in lower-income neighborhoods. In order to minimize such a problem, we would hope to share findings with all stakeholders including members of the community with a vested interest in housing equity.\n",
