    "## Research Question\n",
    "*\"Using ensemble methods, how do our selected institutional investor metrics compare to traditional economic indicators in predicting San Diego housing market movements (2018 - 2023), and can we identify zip codes where investor activity appears to have outsized influence relative to local economic fundamentals?\"*\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Background and Prior Work \n",
    "In recent years, the San Diego housing market has experienced significant changes, notably the increasing involvement of institutional investors in residential real estate. Institutional investors can drive higher house prices based on the demands, they often purchase properties in a large quantity and outbid personal buyers, which limit ownership opportunities. Traditionally, housing market analyses have focused on economic indicators such as employment rates, median income, and interest rates. However, we think the growing presence of institutional investors introduces new dynamics that may not be fully captured by these conventional metrics. Understanding how investor activity interacts with local market fundamentals is crucial for accurately modeling housing price movements and assessing potential long-term impacts in both San Diego housing markets and communities.\n",
    " \n",
    "Research has documented the rising role of institutional investors in the housing market. A report by the U.S. Government Accountability Office (GAO) found that while institutional investors own approximately 2% of single-family rental homes nationwide, their ownership is more concentrated in certain metropolitan areas, such as Atlanta and Charlotte, where they own a larger share of the market. The report suggests that institutional investors' activities can influence local housing markets, potentially affecting home prices and availability (GOA, 2020).\n",
    "\n",
    "In terms of predictive modeling, machine learning techniques have been increasingly applied to housing price prediction. A study published in the International Journal of Advanced Computer Science and Applications explored the use of advanced machine learning algorithms, including support vector regression and artificial neural networks, for predicting house prices. The study found that these models could effectively capture complex patterns in housing data, leading to improved prediction accuracy (AL-Masum, 2021).\n",
    "\n",
    "Despite these advancements, there is a noticeable gap in the literature regarding predictive models that explicitly incorporate institutional investor activity as a variable. Most existing models focus on traditional economic indicators and property features, without accounting for the influence of large-scale investors. Addressing this gap could enhance the accuracy of housing market predictions and provide deeper insights into the factors driving price changes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our machine learning model will possibly incorporate investor purchase volumes, transaction volumes, and properties' owning periods. Some related machine learning algorithms that we potentially will use are linear regression (Predict price based on continuos variables such as medain income or interest rate), Decision Trees (Handling variables in the data while identifying key features that drive housing price changes), Random Forest (Predict housing price with multiple economic and investor-related factors). However, further decisions on which algorithm our group decides to use is needed. \n",
    "\n",
    "Our project aims to fill this gap by developing a predictive model that integrates both traditional economic indicators and data on institutional investor activity. By leveraging machine learning techniques, we seek to assess the impact of institutional investors on housing price movements at the zip code level in the San Diego area. This approach will allow us to identify areas where investor influence is particularly pronounced and evaluate how this influence interacts with other market factors. \n",

    "## Hypothesis\n",
    "We predict that zip codes with high institutional investor activity will show housing price movements that deviate significantly from what traditional economic indicators would suggest. Furthermore, we expect that ensemble methods combining both institutional investor metrics and traditional economic indicators will provide more accurate predictions of housing market movements than either set of metrics alone.\n",

    "## Data\n",
    "\n",
    "### Variables to be Measured:\n",
    "- Monthly housing price indices by zip code\n",
    "- Institutional investor purchase volumes and total transaction values\n",
    "- Property types acquired by investors\n",
    "- Investor hold periods and exit strategies\n",
    "- Traditional economic indicators (unemployment rates, median income, interest rates)\n",
    "- Local demographic data\n",
    "- Building permits and new construction data\n",
    "- Rental market metrics\n",
    "\n",
    "### Potential Data Sources:\n",
    "- **San Diego County Assessor's Office** (property transactions)\n",
    "- **U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics** (economic indicators)\n",
    "- **Federal Reserve Economic Data (FRED)**\n",
    "- **CoreLogic or Zillow** (housing price data)\n",
    "- **SEC filings for publicly traded institutional investors**\n",
    "- **San Diego Association of Governments (SANDAG)** (demographic data)\n",

    "## Ethics & Privacy\n",
    "- **Data Privacy & Restriction** \n",
    "\n",
    "    Data privacy concerns exist regarding property transaction records and demographic information. While most of this data is publicly available, we must ensure our analysis doesn't inadvertently reveal personally identifiable information about individual property owners or tenants. We will aggregate data at the zip code level to maintain privacy. And for those datasets without zip code, we would assign them based on the region or new index to avoid use of any personal information. Besides that, most public datasets have their own restriction policy. For example, Zillow’s market data is available for public viewing but cannot be scraped, stored, or republished without permission. Therefore, ensuring data sets that been used are authorized is another priority.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Bias in Data Collection & Representation**  \n",
    "\n",
    "    There are potential biases in our dataset that need to be acknowledged and addressed. Institutional investor activity may be underreported in certain areas, and some demographic groups might be disproportionately affected by investor activity. We will Cross-reference LLC-owned property counts with proprietary databases like ATTOM, CoreLogic to identify underreported areas. and Compare distributions of race, income, and age in the dataset against 2020 U.S. Census data for San Diego County at the zip code level. For example, mark as underrepresented if Hispanic residents constitute 35% of the county population but only 20% of sampled property owners, and further consider culture difference(like tend to live with family member) to test if bias still persist.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Detection and Mitigation of Bias** \n",
    "\n",
    "    Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) will be conducted to examine demographic distributions and missing data patterns. If biases are detected, adjustments such as re-weighting or stratified sampling will be applied.For example, if gaps exceed 5% absolute difference from Census demographics, methods would be apply to restore the balance.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Post-Analysis Considerations** \n",
    "    \n",
    "    The findings of this research could have implications for housing policy and community development. We must be transparent about our methodology and careful not to draw causative conclusions where only correlative relationships exist. We will also consider the potential impact of our findings on various stakeholders, including local residents, policymakers, and market participants.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Impact on the Market & Community** \n",
    "\n",
    "    As mentioned above, since we have to keep our research transparent, we are aware that revealing areas with high investor activity can unintentionally provide insights for all kinds of market participants, which can further exacerbate affordability problems. If investors significantly raise affordability, this could lead to more displacement in lower-income neighborhoods. In order to minimize such a problem, we would hope to share findings with all stakeholders including members of the community with a vested interest in housing equity.\n",
