    "*\"Using ensemble methods, how do our selected institutional investor metrics compare to traditional economic indicators in predicting San Diego housing market movements (2018 - 2023), and can we identify zip codes where investor activity appears to have outsized influence relative to local economic fundamentals?\"*\n",

    "## Background and Prior Work\n",
    "Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disease that primarily affects memory and cognition, manifesting as classic dementia symptoms. There are two types of AD: familial Alzheimer’s disease (FAD), which is mainly related to genetic factors and usually presents early, and sporadic Alzheimer’s disease (SAD), which is associated with environmental factors and tends to present later in life. SAD is more common and understudied. Research has shown that various environmental factors contribute to SAD onset and progression, including occupational stress, smoking history, and pre-existing mental health conditions. Understanding the relationship between occupational stress and AD onset is crucial to identifying potential risks that could be mitigated to delay disease progression.\n",
    "\n",
    "Previous research has explored the impact of occupational stress on cognitive decline. A study by Then et al. (2014) found that high levels of job-related stress and psychological distress were associated with an increased risk of dementia and earlier onset of cognitive impairment.<sup>[1](#ref1)</sup> Similarly, the Whitehall II study, a long-term cohort study on British civil servants, found that chronic work-related stress and low job control were linked to an increased risk of later-onset dementia.<sup>[2](#ref2)</sup> These findings suggest that occupational stress could be a significant factor influencing SAD, though the exact molecular mechanisms remain under investigation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another important consideration is the role of smoking history and pre-existing mental health conditions as potential confounding variables. Smoking has been identified as a modifiable risk factor for AD, with studies showing that long-term smokers have an increased risk of developing dementia compared to non-smokers.[3] Similarly, mental health disorders such as depression and anxiety have been linked to increased dementia risk, with research indicating that individuals with a history of depression are more likely to experience earlier onset AD.[4]\n",
    "\n",
    "With all these insights, few studies have specifically examined the interplay between occupational stress and the age of AD onset while controlling for smoking history and mental health conditions. This study aims to fill this gap by investigating the relationship between occupational stress levels and AD onset among California residents diagnosed between 2010 and 2023. By addressing these factors, this research could contribute to a deeper understanding of occupational stress associated with AD, potentially informing workplace policies and early intervention strategies.\n",

    "## Hypothesis\n",
    "We expect a high association between occupational stress and early SAD onset time. This prediction is based on numerous findings of the relationship between stress levels and SAD progression. It is expected that prolonged exposure to occupational stress accelerates the onset of AD symptoms.\n",

    "## Data\n",
    "The ideal dataset would include three factors across multiple companies in different fields with similar work hours: smoking history, occupational stress, and previous mental health conditions. Occupational stress could be interpreted by self-reported stress (or just the number of complaints) to the workplace, wage levels, etc. Previous mental health data could be derived from the number of visits to psychiatrists and medical records. These data would be collected from medical records and union surveys, though access may be restricted.\n",
    "\n",
    "Potential sources:\n",
    "- **California Department of Public Health (CDPH):** The CDPH provides reports on Alzheimer's disease and related dementias in California. The report 'Alzheimer's Disease and Related Dementias Facts and Figures in California' offers statistics on prevalence, mortality, and demographics. However, it may lack detailed individual-level information necessary for analyzing occupational stress factors.\n",

    "## Ethics & Privacy\n",
    "- **Data Privacy & Confidentiality:** Since this study relies on health and occupational data, strict privacy protections are necessary. Any dataset used must comply with HIPAA and other relevant regulations to ensure that personally identifiable information (PII) is safeguarded. Aggregated data sources will be prioritized to minimize privacy risks.\n",
    "- **Bias in Data Collection & Representation:** The available datasets may not be fully representative of all demographic groups, leading to biases. Occupational stress data may be based on broad job categories rather than individualized experiences. Multiple datasets will be compared, and weighting techniques may be used to ensure a more equitable representation of different groups.\n",
    "- **Terms of Use & Ethical Data Usage:** Some data sources may have restrictions on usage. Proper permissions and compliance with terms of use will be ensured before any dataset is used. Publicly available government datasets, such as those from the CDPH and Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS), will be prioritized.\n",
    "- **Detection and Mitigation of Bias:** Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) will be conducted to examine demographic distributions and missing data patterns. If biases are detected, adjustments such as re-weighting or stratified sampling will be applied.\n",
    "- **Post-Analysis Considerations:** Findings will be transparently reported to avoid misinterpretation or overgeneralization. Ethical guidelines will be followed in disseminating results, especially regarding occupational stress as a potential risk factor for Alzheimer’s disease.\n",
